# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.

Notably, we're working to make this project contributor-friendly. Please follow the
progress and comment [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/issues/131).

## One-time Setup

### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## TensorFlow Model Optimization Specific

### Style
Please refer to [TensorFlow's style guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/code_style). Don't forget to run pylint.

### Contributing Whole Techniques

See these [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING_TECHNIQUE.md).

### Other Contributions

You are welcome to contribute to issues that are labeled as [contributions
welcome](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22contributions+welcome%22).
These are issues that the OWNER has considered critical enough to fix (e.g.
significant impact on user experience) but has not had the time to fix. The
OWNER also has time to provide basic guidance, which also means the number of issues is intentionally kept small.

Unless a [good first
issue label is attached](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22contributions+welcome%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+), issues will likely require the contributor to individually develop some understanding of the design (e.g. either of tf.keras
or of the technique itself).

If you want to pick up an issue, please comment and wait for a response to
ensure the issue is still important and to potentially provide additional
details not currently in the issue. If you need code pointers, feel free to ask.


## Code reviews

## Community Guidelines
